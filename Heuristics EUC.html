	  <h3>Environmental Control Units for Inpatient Care at VA Hospital</h3>  
	   <section class = "left">
		 <p>In this project, I worked as an evaluator to complete heuristic analyses of the autonoME Hospital Environmental Control Unit (ECU) designed to assist spinal cord injuries and disorders patients. The ECU device allows patients to control their bed and their room environment, as well as to provide communication tools and entertainment. The device can be operated through the touch screen, eye tracking, voice control, or pneumatic sip/puff mechanism depending on the patient’s abilities. I evaluated the touch screen and eye-tracking functions.</p>
		 <p>For each evaluation, we identified four tasks that were previously identified as the most common tasks for ECU use. Then, each evaluator completed the assessment independently. The assessment evaluated for its adherence to Shneiderman’s Eight Golden Rules for Interface Design and Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics. Each evaluator completed each task twice; the first time focused on the overall workflow, and the second time focused on individual elements of the interface.</p>
		   <p> In the end, we reported the results and provided design recommendations. </p>
