		<p> Construction equipment operators are in high demand in recent years. However, on-machine training can be expensive and has potential safety issues. Training to operate different machine types is even less convenient. The increasing demands for construction equipment operators require a new training method to substitute for on-machine training. Using computer-based virtual training systems to train people can reduce risks and training time, and allowing flexibility in the training environment. This study compared training results from an external focus on the tool of a simulated hydraulic excavator and an internal focus on how the operators moving the controls. The main question was whether one focus group outperformed the other. The result showed that internal group had lower execution time and a tendency to have better productivity than the external focus group. However, the difference was less in the retention trials, suggesting that learning efficiency for both instruction groups were approximately equal.
