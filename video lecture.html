	  <h3>Integrated Video Lecture and Learning Efficiency</h3>  
	<section class = "left">	
	<p>This study was my master's thesis. The goal was to investigate how to best present an instructor's close-up in a video lecture to reduce cognitive load.</p>
		<p>Previous studies have suggested that the layout of the close-up and textual content affects the learner's cognitive load. In my study, I tested whether the cognitive load can be affected by the spatial distance of two sources of information or integration (whether the video and text share the same screen). I created four video conditions formed by combining integration and spatial distance. Participants were randomly assigned to one condition to watch one video of easy material and one video of difficult material, and then they reported their perceived mental effort and completed a quiz to evaluate learning outcomes. The result showed no benefits of either video display, however, students reported lower perceived mental effort than non-students. My study suggested that future designers should consider customizing the online learning systems based on learners’ experience with the content and their familiarization with online technologies. </p>
