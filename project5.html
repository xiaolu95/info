	  <h2>Towards Consolidating the UX Knowledge</h2>  
	   <section class = "left">
		<p> The field of user experience was joined by practitioners and researchers from a wide range of disciplines. There were no clear boundaries between UX and other fields such as graphic design and web design. The project goal was to find out the types of knowledge that the UX professionals discussed as they attempted to define what belongs to UX knowledge or not. The project examined a group of UX professionals' online communication practices around UX knowledge on Reddit.</p>
